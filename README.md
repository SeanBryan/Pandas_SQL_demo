# SESE Bootcamp Talk on Python, Numpy, Pandas, and SQLite

Hi Everyone! This is the material for my basic introduction to analyzing scientific data with python

To start, python isn't the only option out there. At a minimum there are Python, R, IDL, Matlab, (root?!), any others? Let's talk about what we're already using.

# Installation

Linux = apt-get or yum or whatever native package management

Mac = homebrew or anaconda is the choice

Windows = I'm so sorry it's come to this...anaconda is fine, but it has its limits


# Numpy Introduction
numpy_outline.py from https://github.com/SeanBryan/DesertPy_Data_Science_Talk/tree/master/numpy_talk

# Getting Started with Pandas

pandas_demo.ipynb is based on an example in the excellent Python for Data Analysis book. The example depends on downloading data from https://github.com/wesm/pydata-book/tree/master/ch02/names

The example also depends on using jupyter notebook. Jupyter is essentially the mathematica user interface, but made available for python, R, and other languages. (That's either a good thing, or a bad thing!)

# Using Pandas with SQL

The other files comprise the pandas/SQL integration demo that I followed from https://plot.ly/python/big-data-analytics-with-pandas-and-sqlite which has a link to the large multi-gigabyte data file you need. (2017 note, the file in that website moved, now it is here: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/311-Service-Requests-from-2010-to-Present/erm2-nwe9 )To help just get started, I included the first 400 lines of that big file as a csv.
