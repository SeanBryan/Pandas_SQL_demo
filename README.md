# Pandas/SQL Demo
My working through two tutorials out there on basic pandas and SQL

The pandas part, something.py, is based on an example in the excellent Python for Data Analysis book. The example depends on downloading data from https://github.com/wesm/pydata-book/tree/master/ch02/names

The other files comprise the pandas/SQL integration demo that I followed from https://plot.ly/python/big-data-analytics-with-pandas-and-sqlite/ which has a link to the large multi-gigabyte data file you need. To help just get started, I included the first 400 lines of that big file as a csv.
