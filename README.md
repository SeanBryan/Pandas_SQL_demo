# SESE Bootcamp Talk on Numpy, Pandas, and SQLite

Hi Everyone! This is the material for my basic introduction to analyzing scientific data with python

To start, python isn't the only option out there. At a minimum there are Python, R, IDL, Matlab, (root?!), any others? Let's talk about what we're already using.

# Installation

Linux = apt-get or yum or whatever native package management
Mac = homebrew or anaconda is the choice
Windows = I'm so sorry it's come to this...anaconda is fine, but it has its limits


# Numpy Introduction

# Getting Started with Pandas

pandas_demo.py is based on an example in the excellent Python for Data Analysis book. The example depends on downloading data from https://github.com/wesm/pydata-book/tree/master/ch02/names

# Using Pandas with SQL

The other files comprise the pandas/SQL integration demo that I followed from https://plot.ly/python/big-data-analytics-with-pandas-and-sqlite/ which has a link to the large multi-gigabyte data file you need. To help just get started, I included the first 400 lines of that big file as a csv.
